FEATURE

o Supported kernel

	Support 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernel (x86 arch)
	
	** I need some x86 Linux boxes (ex sparc, ppc, ..) for testing 
	and ongoing developing vlogger. If you can donate some root access (no 
	illegal pls) or hardware, please drop a line to me at rd@thc.org **


o Log keystrokes of all user sessions

	Console, serial console 
	Remote sessions (telnet, ssh, etc)


o Stealth mechanism

	No syscall modifying

	Super User (in the box itself) neither see nor sniff log packets
		Sniffers such as tcpdump in the box can not see the traffic
		Bypassing network filtering/firewall rules in the box

	Module hiding (tool/modclean.c)
		Remove vlogger module from the module list
		KSTAT can not detect the removed module
		
	Module injection (tool/modinject)
		Inject vlogger module into another kernel module


o Multiple logging modes and methods

	Support three logging modes
		Switch between logging modes by specific keys sequence
		Default toggle character is CTRL-]

	Dumb mode
		Logs all keystrokes

	Smart mode
		Ability to detect password prompt automatically to log only 
		sensitive data such as user/password (ssh, telnet, su, sudo, 
		ftp, ...)

	Normal mode 
		Stop logging mode


o Log methods

	Log to files
	
	Remote log over network
		Transmits log data to a specified machine


o Log data

	Separated logging for each tty/session
		Each tty has their own log buffer
		Easier to track sessions

	Timestamps logging

	Nearly support all special chars
		Arrow keys (left, right, up, down), Home, Page Up, Page Down
		F1 to F12, Shift+F1 to Shift+F12
		ALT- and CTRL- combinations 
		Tab, Insert, Delete, End, Backspace, ...

	Support line editing keys included CTRL-U and Backspace
